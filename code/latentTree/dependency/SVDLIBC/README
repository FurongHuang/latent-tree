Based on Doug Rohde's SVD C Library version 1.34 http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/SVDLIBC/

Look there for possible improvements.

The product now compiles under VS2008 and produces a dll. 
vs_dll directory provides the VS project.

The dll exports functions as shown in svdlibc.def.

A Python ctypes interface example is to follow.

KNOWN BUGS:
 - mingw under cygwin creates a dll, which hangs on function calls
